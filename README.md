AutoDRIVE Testbed is a hardware platform for prototyping and testing autonomous driving solutions. It comprises of a scaled vehicle model (called Nigel) and a modular infrastructure development kit. The vehicle is equipped with a comprehensive sensor suite for redundant perception, a set of actuators for constrained motion control and a fully functional lighting system for illumination and signaling. It can be teleoperated (in manual mode) or self-driven (in autonomous mode). The infrastructure development kit comprises of various environment modules along with active and passive traffic elements.
