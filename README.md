AutoDRIVE Simulator is a digital twin of the AutoDRIVE Testbed, which enables the users to virtually prototype their algorithms either due to hardware limitations or as a part of the reiterative development cycle.

The AutoDRIVE Simulator is a pseudo-realistic simulator for scaled autonomous vehicles, which is targeted towards simplicity, modularity and flexibility. The simulator is developed atop the Unity game engine, which enables simulation of realistic physics (using NVIDIA’s PhysX Engine) and photorealistic graphics (using Unity’s Post-Processing Stack). The simulator simulates a comprehensive sensor suite and realistic actuator response, and also features a communication bridge in order to interface externally developed autonomous driving software stack. Presently, the bridge is compatible with Robot Operating System (ROS) and offers a direct scripting support for Python and C++. The bridge supports local as well as distributed computing.

The simulator can be exploited by the users (particularly targeting students and researchers in the field) in order to develop and test their algorithms aimed at autonomous driving.
