# AutoDRIVE SDK | ROS

This directory hosts the `autodrive` ROS package, which supports modular algorithm development targetted towards autonomous driving. It uses client libraries for C++ and Python, and can be therefore exploited to develop your algorithms flexibly; this also opens up a wide avenue for the development of hybrid high-performance algorithms aimed at autonomous driving.
